# Perceptron-logic-gates
Perceptron used to classify logic gates

Do the following:
- Perceptron Learning Algorithm Program
- Train the Perceptron to behave as a logic gate AND, OR and XOR
- Graph the training points with different color for each class and draw the line represented by the biological Neuron already trained.
- Make a report that contains the following:
- Your name and student code
- A brief review of the McCulloch-Pitts Model (half page)
- A brief review of the Perceptron algorithm (half a page)
- Your implementation code
- Your graphs with the results
- Answer back:
- Why can't the XOR gate be learned by this model?
- How important is the learning factor?
